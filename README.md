# GetPhoneNumber
Get phone number from website

If you want to download phone number with specified prefix, you can run command like below:

`./get_phone.py 1505825`

Note:
1. Make sure you have created a folder with name `specify`.
2. This code will generate lots of files, you can run `clean.sh` to clean it.
Next:
1. I will use request lib to get content of website instead of download it.
